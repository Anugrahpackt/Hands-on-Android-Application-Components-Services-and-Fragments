## About the Video Course
It's always been a big pain for developers to understand the implementation of background threads and processes and master building flexible UI's and how to effectively use services in their applications. Not all Android developers have any experience of fragments, but this course will help you master fragments and services from scratch!
In this course, you will start by getting familiar with the fundamental concepts of fragments and adding fragments to an activity, fragment transactions, their lifecycle, and how they communicate with activities. You'll also explore fragment stability during screen rotation, and screen sizes. Then you will learn about services, another application component that will continue to run in the background even if the user switches to another application. Here you will get hands-on with the various kinds of services, threads, and processes, and their life cycle; then you'll move on to inter-process communication. Lastly, you will implement everything you've learned and build a TODO application; you'll learn to pass and manage arguments and master the communication flow between services and fragments in multiple ways. By the end of this course, you'll have a very strong foundation in Android fragments and Android services.
